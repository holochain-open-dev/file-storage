# @holochain-open-dev/file-storage

The file-storage zomes and its accompanying frontend module are designed to implement storing and retreiving files in a Holochain DHT.

Existing functionalities:

- Upload a file.
- Retrieve a file by its hash.
- Element that uploads a file to the DHT [`<show-image>`]().
- Element that shows an image from its hash [`<show-image>`]().

This module follows the [holochain-open-dev](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/) pattern of developing holochain modules. Read [its documentation](https://holochain-open-dev.github.io) to understand more about its motivation and the big picture.
