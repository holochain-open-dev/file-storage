# mdjs story

Rendering storybook story functions inline.

Is typcially used via an markdown file which gets parsed by `@mdjs/core`.

The code snippet will actually get executed at that place and you will have a live demo

````md
```js story
export const JsStory = () =>
  html`
    <demo-wc-card>JS Story</demo-wc-card>
  `;
```
````

e.g. the `js story` is a marker to define that its content gets "rendered" with `<mdjs-story>`.

## Element itself

```html
<mdjs-story></mdjs-story>
```

```js
import { html } from 'lit-html';

const myElStory = () => html`
  <my-el></my-el>
`;

document.querySelector('mdjs-story').story = myElStory;
```
