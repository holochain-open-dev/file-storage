/**
 * A lit directive implementation of @material/mdc-snackbar/util.ts#announce,
 * which does some tricks to ensure that snackbar labels will be handled
 * correctly by screen readers.
 *
 * The existing MDC announce util function is difficult to use directly here,
 * because Lit can crash when DOM that it is managing changes outside of its
 * purvue. In this case, we would render our labelText as the text content of
 * the label div, but the MDC announce function then clears that text content,
 * and resets it after a timeout (see below for why). We do the same thing here,
 * but in a way that fits into Lit's lifecycle.
 *
 * TODO(aomarks) Investigate whether this can be simplified; but to do that we
 * first need testing infrastructure to verify that it remains compatible with
 * screen readers. For example, can we just create an entirely new label node
 * every time we open or labelText changes? If not, and the async text/::before
 * swap is strictly required, can we at elast make this directive more generic
 * (e.g. so that we don't hard-code the name of the label class).
