/**
 * A lit directive implementation of @material/mdc-snackbar/util.ts#announce,
 * which does some tricks to ensure that snackbar labels will be handled
 * correctly by screen readers.
 *
 * The existing MDC announce util function is difficult to use directly here,
 * because Lit can crash when DOM that it is managing changes outside of its
 * purvue. In this case, we would render our labelText as the text content of
 * the label div, but the MDC announce function then clears that text content,
 * and resets it after a timeout (see below for why). We do the same thing here,
 * but in a way that fits into Lit's lifecycle.
 *
 * TODO(aomarks) Investigate whether this can be simplified; but to do that we
 * first need testing infrastructure to verify that it remains compatible with
 * screen readers. For example, can we just create an entirely new label node
 * every time we open or labelText changes? If not, and the async text/::before
 * swap is strictly required, can we at elast make this directive more generic
 * (e.g. so that we don't hard-code the name of the label class).

    // be detected by screen readers. `aria-live` elements are only announced
    // when the element's `textContent` *changes*, so snackbars sent to the
    // browser in the initial HTML response won't be read unless we clear the
    // element's `textContent` first. Similarly, displaying the same snackbar
    // message twice in a row doesn't trigger a DOM mutation event, so screen
    // readers won't announce the second message unless we first clear
    // `textContent`.
    //
    // We have to clear the label text two different ways to make it work in
    // all browsers and screen readers:
    //
    //   1. `textContent = ''` is required for IE11 + JAWS
    //   2. `innerHTML = '&nbsp;'` is required for Chrome + JAWS and NVDA
    //
    // All other browser/screen reader combinations support both methods.
    //
    // The wrapper `<span>` visually hides the space character so that it
    // doesn't cause jank when added/removed. N.B.: Setting `position:
    // absolute`, `opacity: 0`, or `height: 0` prevents Chrome from detecting
    // the DOM change.
    //
    // This technique has been tested in:
    //
    //   * JAWS 2019:
    //       - Chrome 70
    //       - Firefox 60 (ESR)
    //       - IE 11
    //   * NVDA 2018:
    //       - Chrome 70
    //       - Firefox 60 (ESR)
    //       - IE 11
    //   * ChromeVox 53
